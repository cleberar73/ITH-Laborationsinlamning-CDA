There are 52 cards in a Blackjack game.
From numbers 2-10 and character J,Q,K,A.
There are 4 types/symbols of cards - Red Hearts, Black Spads, Red Diamonds, Black Clovers.
Taking this info into consideration we have 4x9=36 set for the number and 4x4=16 set for the characters.
The value of the characters are as following: J,Q,K are equivalent to 10 and A is equivalent to 1.
In my mind to be easier the character can be transformed into extra 10's and A's into numbers 1's.

Here I created the deck manually to understand how I would fill it using the for, while loop, count, append if and else.

**deck** = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]

Using Visual Studio Code open the file blackjack.py and Run Python file with the play button on the righ topcorner of the application.
The program blackjack.py runs and create the deck and shuffle the cads and deal the cards to the player and computer.
A friendly menu is created and there are the 3 follwoing choices:
1.  User ask for more card. 
2.  User stop asking for card.
3.  User quit the blackjack.
  
**Obs**.: In order to play the game again you have to quit the game using the option 3 and Run Python file again.
  
**Bugs**: When the computer loose the game it is showing twice the message! I am working on it.
 
 Thanks
